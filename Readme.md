## RIP qtBrew

Given my recent exploration into the world of web development, I have decided to implement this project as a website.  Please check out:  https://github.com/drodrz/Brew

## Overview

Brewing software these days, while powerful, tends to be cumbersome to use and configure.  This is my humble attempt at an easy to use brewing app.  It will initially be suited to my current process.  Hopefully it will grow to be more versatile as it matures.

## Features

Not many.  Currently just working on the underlying framework.  Maybe a few handy calculators soon(tm).

## Roadmap

- Recipe Formulation + management
- Brewday timer + note taking
- Equipment Manager
- Yeast Starter
- Water chemistry
- BeerXML Support
- Web-based interface
- etc...
